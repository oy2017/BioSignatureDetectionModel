# Methodology for Biosignature Detection in Synthetic Exoplanet Spectra

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this work is to establish a robust, scientifically-grounded methodology for identifying potential biosignatures within synthetic exoplanet atmospheric data generated by the `MultiREx` software package. This methodology is specifically tailored to the observational capabilities of the European Space Agency's (ESA) upcoming Ariel mission, ensuring that the criteria for biosignature identification are relevant for future large-scale atmospheric surveys ("Ariel Factsheet").

## 2. Defining a Detectable Biosignature

The foundational criterion for a robust biosignature is the presence of a significant chemical disequilibrium in a planet's atmosphere. Such a state implies the existence of a continuous source, likely a global biosphere, that prevents the atmosphere from reaching chemical equilibrium ("Atmospheric Biosignatures").

Based on an analysis of current research, the simultaneous presence of methane (CH4) and ozone (O3) has been selected as the primary target biosignature. The rationale is as follows:

*   **Ozone as a Proxy for Oxygen:** While molecular oxygen (O2) is a primary product of photosynthesis on Earth, its direct detection in exoplanet atmospheres via transmission spectroscopy is challenging. Ozone (O3), a photochemical byproduct of O2, exhibits a much stronger spectral signature in the infrared wavelengths that Ariel will observe, making it a more practical proxy for identifying an oxygen-rich atmosphere.
*   **Redox Disequilibrium:** Methane is a reducing gas, while ozone is a strong oxidizing agent. Their coexistence in significant quantities is a classic indicator of a "redox disequilibrium." In the absence of a constant source, these gases would rapidly react and destroy one another. Therefore, their simultaneous detection is a compelling sign of an active, planet-scale process, such as biological activity, that is continuously replenishing both compounds (Duque-Castaño et al.).

## 3. Establishing Detection Thresholds

The thresholds for detection are not arbitrary but are defined by a balance between biological significance (i.e., concentrations comparable to those found on Earth) and the practical detection limits of a survey instrument like Ariel.

*   **Methane (CH4) Threshold: 10⁻⁶ (1 ppm):** This mixing ratio is comparable to the methane concentration in Earth's atmosphere. Research demonstrates that a CH4 concentration of 10⁻⁶ is detectable with a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of ~1-3, which can be achieved with as few as 1-10 transit observations for a favorable target like TRAPPIST-1e. This makes it a feasible target for Ariel's survey-oriented approach (Duque-Castaño et al.).

*   **Ozone (O3) Threshold: 10⁻⁷ (0.1 ppm):** This concentration is also biologically significant. Its detection is more observationally demanding than methane, requiring a higher SNR (in the range of 10-15) and consequently a greater number of transits (30-50). While more challenging, this is still considered achievable for high-priority candidates identified during Ariel's survey phase (Duque-Castaño et al.).

## 4. Implementation

This methodology has been implemented in the `generate_multiverse_data.py` script. The `check_biosignature` function identifies systems where both CH4 and O3 are present above their defined thresholds. The thresholds are defined by the `bio_threshold_ch4` and `bio_threshold_o3` variables, which reflect the `10⁻⁶` and `10⁻⁷` values for CH4 and O3, respectively.
